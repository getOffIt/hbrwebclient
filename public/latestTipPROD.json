    "content": "Starting a business isn’t easy — and scaling it is even harder — so you need to be committed. Before sending that “I quit!” email you’ve been fantasizing about, identify a problem that you have a personal connection to and that you’re driven to solve. It could be that you’ve identified shortcomings particular to your industry. Maybe you’re part of a consumer segment that’s underserved by the current offerings. Or perhaps you regularly encounter a very specific frustration that others are sure to share. Next, make sure you’re clear on the value you’ll bring to customers. How will you make their lives easier, more pleasant, or more meaningful? How will you go out of your way for them at every turn? However you come to your idea, you should feel like you have no choice but to start this particular business at this moment in time. It will make the mornings when you wake up and wish that it was someone else’s problem much easier to bear.\n\nThis tip adapted from “So You Want to Be an Entrepreneur?” by Emily Heyward"
